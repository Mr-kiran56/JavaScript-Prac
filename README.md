## âœ¨ JavaScript Project Showcase

JavaScript brings webpages to life by enabling dynamic interactions, logic, and automation. Below are some awesome examples that highlight its versatility:

### ðŸŽ® 1. Rockâ€“Paperâ€“Scissors Game (with Auto Play)
- A fully interactive mini-game where users play against the computer.
- Features an **Auto Play mode** â€” JavaScript randomly picks moves in rapid sequence, mimicking a non-stop bot battle.
- Tracks wins, losses, and draws, demonstrating logic handling and DOM updates in real time.
- Great showcase of conditionals, event listeners, and setInterval for timing.

### ðŸ§® 2. Calculator
- Simple yet powerful calculator for basic arithmetic operations (+, â€“, Ã—, Ã·).
- Handles **user input** smoothly via buttons or keyboard events.
- Uses JavaScript to evaluate expressions and update the display.
- Demonstrates how to manage state, handle edge cases (like multiple decimals), and format results cleanly.

### âœ… 3. To-Do List
- A productivity app that lets users **add**, **edit**, **delete**, and **mark tasks complete**.
- Implements array manipulation, local storage (to save tasks across sessions), and responsive UI updates.
- Perfect example of using functions to dynamically manipulate DOM elements based on user actions.
